    <h2><i>What is CSS?</i></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheet. </li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML element displayed on screen paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li> <span> CSS is not necessory</span> <span class="y"> CSS saves lots of Work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once.</li>
        <li id="line"><i>External Stylesheets are stored in CSS files</i></li>
    </ol>
<h2><i> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</i></h2>
<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies   astyle to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to oneunique  element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to linkdirectly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.</p>

    <ul class="space">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.<li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="y"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
